## Experience

I currently work at [**4K Download**](https://www.4kdownload.com/) as a Senior Product Designer. Previously, I spent time building things at [**Ai Video Cut**](https://aivideocut.com/), [**Waveroom**](https://waveroom.com/), [**LALAL.AI**](https://www.lalal.ai/), and various digital agencies. You can view my full resume [**here**](https://resume.co/@uo2vEbIC3eeNhROjMIw1).

## Principles

I believe deeply in products that are profoundly simple, essentially practical, and essentially human. For over 14 years, I've shaped global experiences, bringing ideas from zero to one with clarity and care.
