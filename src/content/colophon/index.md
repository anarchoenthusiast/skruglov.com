## About this site

I designed and built this site myself. It's a home to share my work, thoughts, and experiences as a product designer and engineer. The design emphasizes simplicity, readability, and performanceâ€”putting content first.

## Technology

This site is built using [**Astro**](https://astro.build/). Content is written in [**MDX**](https://mdxjs.com/), with full [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety.

The initial foundation was based on the [**AstroNano**](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano) template, though it has been extensively modified and customized to match my design vision and requirements.

Code is edited using [**Cursor**](https://cursor.sh/) on a [**MacBook Air M1**](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/). My terminal of choice is [**Warp**](https://www.warp.dev/).

Domain registration is through [**iWantMyName**](https://iwantmyname.com/). Hosting and deployment are via [**Netlify**](https://netlify.com/). Email is handled by [**Proton Mail**](https://proton.me/mail).

## Typography

Text is set in [**Tiempos Text**](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-text/) for headings with [**Scto Grotesk B**](https://www.schick-toikka.com/scto-grotesk-b) for body text and UI elements. Typography scales fluidly across devices using responsive design principles.

## Styling

Styles are written using [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) with custom components. The design system supports both light and dark modes with careful attention to contrast ratios and accessibility standards.

## Accessibility

This site aims to conform to [**WCAG 2.1 AA**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aaa) accessibility standards. Features include semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

## Privacy

I collect basic, fully-anonymized page view analytics using [**Fathom Analytics**](https://usefathom.com/). No tracking scripts, personal data collection, or invasive analytics.
